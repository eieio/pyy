Release Notes

06/13/2008

This is the first release of Pyy, a relatively simple, but very flexible IRC
bot. It is written and tested in Python 2.5 and though I haven't tested it on
many platforms, it should work without problems on any platform with 2.5
language support.

Some possible points of interest:
	* Extension modules are found in the modules directory under the base dir.
	* Modules are used to implement even the bare minimum conversation with the
	  server. Take a look at the modules default.py, ctcp.py, and bot.py to see
	  how this works.
	* There are four kinds of "hooks" that modules can use to extend the bot:
	  ProtocolHandler, CtcpCommandHandler, BotCommandHandler,
	  and MessageHandler. These are decorators that automatically hook the
	  decorated function into list of handlers of the respective type. Look at
	  irclib.py, bot.py, and ctcp.py to see how these work.
	* The admin.py module supplies an additional decorator that can be chained
	  with BotCommandHandler to automatically enforce the token based access
	  policy on that command.
